# Changelog — iTunes Backup Explorer (Fork)

Documentation of all improvements implemented on top of the [original project](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04/iTunes-Backup-Explorer) by [MaxiHuHe04](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04).

The original project provided basic navigation of encrypted iTunes backups. This fork transforms it into a complete iPhone toolkit, adding screen mirroring, media gallery, live device control, backup creation, and a modern interface.

## Recent changes

### PR review adjustments

- Fixed Media tab gallery resize — FlowPane now recalculates columns when the window or SplitPane divider is resized
- Translated all 40 Portuguese strings in `mirror_stream.py` to English
- Restored "Hide symlinks and empty folders" checkbox in the Files tab with functional filter

**Commits:** `4e7e5ef`

### USB mirror FPS optimization

- Moved frame processing (`optimize_frame`) from the sequential consumer into parallel capture workers — each worker now captures, resizes, and encodes independently
- Changed image resampling from `BILINEAR` to `NEAREST` (significantly faster resize)
- Reduced max output resolution from 1280px to 960px (less data per frame)
- Lowered JPEG quality from 65 to 50 (smaller frame size, faster encode)
- Increased parallel workers from 3 to 4 concurrent USB connections
- Added bounded queue (`maxsize=8`) to prevent memory buildup from stale frames

### Backup progress fix for Linux

- Fixed backup progress parsing on Linux with improved speed calculation
- Exponential smoothing for transfer speed display (0.3 instant + 0.7 previous)
- Better ETA estimation based on remaining bytes and smoothed speed
- Improved tqdm output parsing for pymobiledevice3 backend (char-by-char reading to capture `\r` lines)
- Progress milestones logged every 5%

**Commits:** `c5b7c32`

### ImageMagick portable download fix

- Fixed ImageMagick download URL — GitHub releases now only distribute `.7z` archives instead of `.zip`
- Added Apache Commons Compress and XZ dependencies for 7z extraction support
- Changed download format from ZIP to 7z with proper extraction
- Simplified Files tab by removing ImageMagick as a build-time dependency

**Commits:** `75e4c9c`, `a9d7fdb`

### Dialog theme consistency

- Applied dark/light theme to all native dialogs and alerts (password prompt, confirmations, errors)
- Dialogs now use the same stylesheet and theme class as the main window

**Commits:** `6e2047e`

### Device tab pymobiledevice3 fallback

- Fixed Device tab not recognizing connected iPhone when libimobiledevice is unavailable
- Both `initialize()` and `pollDevice()` now check for pymobiledevice3 as a fallback backend
- App listing now works via pymobiledevice3 (`InstallationProxyService`) when `ideviceinstaller` is not available
- App uninstall now works via pymobiledevice3 as a fallback

**Commits:** `d946224`

### Mirror/Screen mirroring Windows compatibility

- Fixed tunnel startup on Windows — uses PowerShell `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` instead of `pkexec` for privilege elevation
- Removed `--daemonize` flag on Windows (`os.fork()` does not exist on Windows; `Start-Process` already detaches the process)
- Fixed process termination on Windows — uses `taskkill /F /IM` instead of `pkill`
- Adapted `mirror_stream.py` for Windows: TCP socket instead of pipe file descriptors, conditional `select` import, uxplay search in common install directories
- Fixed `try_auto_mount` to find `pymobiledevice3.exe` on Windows (was looking for the Linux name without `.exe`)
- **AirPlay mirroring temporarily disabled** on Windows due to incompatibility with Windows 11 Smart App Control (blocks unsigned uxplay-windows installer). USB mirroring works normally. AirPlay remains fully functional on Linux.

**Commits:** `7e3545b`

|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| libimobiledevice | Device tab, USB backup | `sudo apt install libimobiledevice-utils` | Included in Apple Devices / iTunes |
| pymobiledevice3 | Mirror tab, backup fallback, device info | `pip install pymobiledevice3` | **Automatic** (downloads portable Python 3.12.8 if needed) |
| ffmpeg | Video thumbnails | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` | **Automatic** (downloads on first need) |
| ImageMagick | HEIC thumbnails | `sudo apt install imagemagick libheif1` | **Automatic** (downloads on first need) |
| uxplay | AirPlay wireless mirroring | `sudo apt install uxplay` | Not available (temporarily disabled) |

### How to use

#### Browse backups

1. Open the app — iTunes/Finder backups are detected automatically
2. If the backup is encrypted, enter the password when prompted
3. Browse the tabs: **Info**, **Files**, **Media**, **Apps**, **Search**
4. To open a backup from another location: `Ctrl+O` or drag the folder onto the sidebar

#### Create iPhone backup

1. Connect the iPhone via USB and tap "Trust" on the device
2. Click **Create Backup** on the welcome screen
3. Choose the destination
4. Follow the progress — cancellable at any time

> On Windows, if no communication tool is installed, the app offers to install automatically.

#### Media gallery

1. Open a backup and unlock if needed
2. Go to the **Media** tab
3. Use filters (All / Photos / Videos) and pagination
4. Click a thumbnail for preview, double-click to open the file
5. Use **Export** to save individual files or in batch

> On Windows, if thumbnails don't appear for videos or HEIC, the app offers to download ffmpeg and ImageMagick automatically.

#### Screen mirroring

1. Go to the **Mirror** tab
2. Connect the iPhone via USB — the app detects it and starts the stream
3. On iOS 17+, the app will request admin privileges to start the tunnel service
4. Tap and swipe on the mirrored screen to interact (requires WDA)

> AirPlay wireless mirroring is currently available on Linux only. On Windows, it is temporarily disabled due to Smart App Control compatibility issues.

#### Device control

1. Connect the iPhone via USB
2. Go to the **Device** tab
3. View info, battery, storage and installed apps
4. Use the buttons for screenshot, restart, shutdown or suspend

> If libimobiledevice is not available, the app automatically falls back to pymobiledevice3 for device detection, info, app listing, and uninstall.

### Compiling and running

**Windows:**
```
compile.bat
run.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./compile.sh
./run.sh
```

`compile` builds the fat JAR. `run` compiles (if needed) and launches the app.

## Project origin

This project is a fork of the original [iTunes Backup Explorer](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04/iTunes-Backup-Explorer) by [MaxiHuHe04](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04). The original project provided the foundation for navigating encrypted iTunes backups with AES-256 and Apple KeyBag support. This fork significantly extends the project with screen mirroring, media gallery, live device control, backup creation, automatic tool setup, and a completely redesigned modern interface.
