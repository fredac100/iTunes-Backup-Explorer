## What is iTunes Backup Explorer?

iTunes Backup Explorer is a **free, open-source desktop app** that lets you browse and manage iPhone backups on any platform. It also connects to your iPhone for real-time screen mirroring, device management, and full backup creation. No cloud, no subscriptions, no data collection.

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredac100/iTunes-Backup-Explorer.git
cd iTunes-Backup-Explorer
```

**Windows:**
```
compile.bat
run.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./compile.sh
./run.sh
```

`compile` builds the fat JAR (required on first run). `run` launches the app.

> Requires **JDK 18+** and **Apache Maven**.

<details>
<summary>Advanced Maven commands</summary>

```bash
# Native executable + installer
mvn clean package

# Fat JAR (cross-platform)
mvn clean compile assembly:single

# Multi-platform JAR (Windows + Linux + ARM macOS)
mvn clean compile assembly:single -Pmost_platforms

# Run directly (development)
mvn exec:exec
```
</details>

## Installation

### Optional Dependencies

These tools are only needed for specific features. **On Windows, the app downloads them automatically** when needed.

| Dependency | Purpose | Linux | Windows |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|
| [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice) | Device tab, USB backup | `sudo apt install libimobiledevice-utils` | Included in Apple Devices / iTunes |
| [pymobiledevice3](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3) | Mirror tab, device fallback, backup fallback | `pip install pymobiledevice3` | **Automatic** (downloads portable Python 3.12.8 if needed) |
| [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) | Video thumbnails in Media tab | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` | **Automatic** (downloaded on first need, ~85 MB) |
| [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) | HEIC/HEIF thumbnails in Media tab | `sudo apt install imagemagick libheif1` | **Automatic** (downloaded on first need, ~50 MB) |
| [uxplay](https://github.com/antimof/UxPlay) | AirPlay wireless mirroring | `sudo apt install uxplay` | Not available (temporarily disabled) |

The app works fully for backup browsing, media gallery, and file management without these dependencies.

> **Note on Windows auto-setup:** When a tool is missing, the app offers to download and set it up automatically. Portable tools are stored in `~/.config/itunes-backup-explorer/` and don't require admin privileges or system-wide installation.

## File Search Syntax

The search tab uses case-insensitive SQLite LIKE syntax with two wildcards:

- `%` — matches any sequence of zero or more characters
- `_` — matches any single character
- `\` — escape character

**Quick filters** are available for common searches: Photos, Videos, WhatsApp, Contacts, Messages, Notes, Voice Memos.

**Examples:**

| Goal | Domain | Relative Path |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Camera roll videos | `CameraRollDomain` | `%.mov` |
| Files under DCIM | `CameraRollDomain` | `Media/DCIM/%` |
| All SQLite databases | `%` | `%.sqlite` |
| WhatsApp files | `%whatsapp%` | `%` |
| iCloud app documents | `HomeDomain` | `Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~%` |
| All files | `%` | `%` |

## Privacy

This application does **not** collect any data. It does not use an internet connection at any point. All processing happens entirely on your local machine.

## Origin

iTunes Backup Explorer is a fork of the [original iTunes Backup Explorer](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04/iTunes-Backup-Explorer) by [MaxiHuHe04](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04), which provided the foundation for encrypted backup browsing. This project extends it with screen mirroring, media gallery, live device control, backup creation, automatic tool setup, and a modern UI.
